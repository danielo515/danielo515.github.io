# JSON Tools

## Motivation

My daily work and my hobbies forces me to work wit large sets of JSON collections, 
usually comprising hundreds or thousands of objects.
This is a small collection of focused but useful tools that saves me hours of JSON processing, all on a single and easily
accessible place.

## Technologies used

The Quasar framework is the base of the tool, which uses `VUE 2.0` under the hood.
For text editting the Monaco editor is used, which is the editor that empowers the great `VSCode` editor.
