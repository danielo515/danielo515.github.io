My name is Daniel, but my friends call me *Danielo* (because there is always another Daniel around)

I started programming when I was **12 yeas old through video game programming**, almost by accident (chech the [blog post](./blog/how-i-started) post for more details). It was a fun but thought experience because it was before the internet was mainstream and my english level was not very high.
However, it was enough to get my brain addicted to problem solving and computer science.

I started my professional career as a support technician because getting a job as developer without experience was too hard. But as long as there were problems to solve and computers involved I was happy.

I was however, writing little programs every time I could and eventually I get myself into the dev position I always wanted.
