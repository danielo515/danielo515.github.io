I lead the creation of the in-house booking engine and inventory system.
I owned the entire process, from understanding and requirements and help product to collect them, to plan the required tasks and assign them to the available developers, myself included.
It was a challenging project because we were on a tight deadline, and we were also aiming at replacing an already existing solution that we were using for this purpose.
Carefully planning and specially prioritizing the most important parts was key to the success of the project.
