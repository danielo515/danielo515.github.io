At Rhino.fi, a leading **Web3 crypto bridge**, I contributed to the **Bridge and Infrastructure team**, focusing on the development and maintenance of its the bridge core functionalities.
I quickly became productive by leveraging my expertise in **Effect-TS** and I actively mentored team members through the intricacies of the framework.
My contributions included building an IP blacklisting/whitelisting mechanism.
During this role, I significantly deepened my knowledge of **Nix**.
The architecture was event-based and deployed on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.
