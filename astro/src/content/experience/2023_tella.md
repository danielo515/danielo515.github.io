Tella is an innovative screen recording platform with a web based editor that requires no installation at all.
As it was a very little startup, I did anything the company needed.
I took ownership of the automatic subtitles generation, displaying and edition end to end.
The frontend was built with react and ReasonML, which is a type safe functional programming language that I learned while working there.
I also had to write some little services in **Rust**, which I learned along the way.
