Not a very impressive app, but unlike many other toy projects, this is a great
example of something that I actually use on a daily basis for several years.
It is also an example of long-term maintance.
This project started as a technical challenge, using a dedicated backend and it was not a single page application.
Since its inception I migrated it trough several versions of react (from 15 up to 18) replaced the backend with firebase, and even migrated it from Javascript to Typescript.
