This was the perfect opportunity to over-engineer a wedding invitation. The publicly available part only shows you the when, the where and a little form to confirm assistance.  That public part already has some interesting easter eggs like the background "sky" changing depending on the time of the day you visit, and even some fireworks. Everything is fully responsive.
With the invitation guests received a QR code to "login" into their personal accounts, and there is where the fun begins. The list of features includes:

- A gallery where guests can upload, like and even comment on photos
- A guestbook where you can leave a message to the couple
- A profile page where you can change your details such as name, alimentary allergies or even an avatar
- A chat that nobody used
- A button to trigger confetti, fireworks, and yelling that will sound on every device that has the site open
